ATI OverDrive5 API

ATI OverDrive is a feature that allows the end-users to customize the performance state and fan speed control of their AMD product. This is accomplished through a set of interfaces that are exposed to the UI application. The application can:
  * Get access to any adapter in a single adapter, multi-adapter, CrossFire, and mixed configurations
  * Check whether OverDrive Version 5 is supported on the adapter
  * Get information about standard performance and power saving states available on the adapter
  * Get information about state parameter ranges available for customization
  * Define a custom set of performance states
  * Test custom settings
  * Get information about the current active performance configuration
  * Get information about the thermal controller connected to the GPU
  * Get the current GPU temperature
  * Get information about the available fan speed and control options
  * Set a custom fan speed
